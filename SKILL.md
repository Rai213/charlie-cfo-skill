description: Financial management frameworks for bootstrapped, high-growth startups. Use when the user asks about cash management, runway calculations, financial forecasting, capital allocation, hiring ROI, unit economics (LTV:CAC), burn rate analysis, working capital optimization, or balancing growth with profitability without venture capital. Triggers on questions like "should we make this hire?", "how much runway do we need?", "what metrics should I track?", "how do I forecast revenue?", or any strategic financial decision at a self-funded company.

# Charlie CFO: Bootstrapped Financial Management

Your AI CFO for bootstrapped, profitable companies. Named after Charlie Munger, who embodied the principle that capital discipline is a competitive advantage.

## Core Mental Models

**Profit is a constraint, not a goal.** Bootstrapped companies succeed because capital constraints force better decisions. Every dollar has three costs: direct expenditure, opportunity cost, and runway impact.

**Unit economics are survival requirements:**

- LTV ≥ 3x CAC (best-in-class: 7-8x)
- CAC payback < 12 months (high performers: 5-7 months)
- Violating these creates a death spiral bootstrapped companies cannot survive

**Revenue per employee is your efficiency scorecard:**

- $110-150K at $1-5M ARR
- $200-250K at $10-50M ARR
- $400K+ at maturity
- Bootstrapped companies run 40-70% higher than VC-backed peers

## Cash Management Rules

**Runway targets:**

- Minimum: 24-36 months
- Danger zone: <12 months (you've lost control)
- Never fundraise your way out of a cash crisis

**Reserve structure:**
| Reserve | Amount | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Operating | 3-6 months fixed costs | Payroll, rent, essential software |
| Contingency | 1-2 months expenses | Emergencies |
| Growth | Excess | Opportunistic investments |

**Burn multiple** = Net Burn ÷ Net New ARR

- <1x: Excellent
- 1-1.5x: Good
- > 2x: Concerning
- Bootstrapped target: Zero or negative (profitable growth)

## Capital Allocation Framework

**Every investment question:** What is the payback period? Target <12 months.

**Rule of 40:** Revenue Growth % + EBITDA Margin % ≥ 40%

- High growth path: 40% + 0%
- Balanced path: 20% + 20%
- Profit path: 10% + 30%

**Hiring decisions:**

1. Will this hire directly contribute to revenue?
2. What's the time-to-productivity? (Factor into ROI)
3. What else could this salary fund?
4. Does this make existing team more productive?

**Never grow a department >50% at once** — productivity drops to zero during training.

## Working Capital Optimization

**Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** DIO + DSO - DPO

- SaaS target: Negative (-30 to -90 days)
- Every 10-day reduction frees significant working capital

**AR discipline:** Target 30-45 days DSO

- Reminder 7 days before due
- Follow up Day 1, 7, 14, 30 past due

**AP strategy:** Pay on due date, not early, unless discount > cost of capital

- 2% discount for 20 days early = 36.5% annualized return
- Negotiate Net 45-60 terms after proving reliability

**Annual prepay:** Offer 15-20% discount

- Produces 30% lower churn
- 27-40% higher LTV
- Customers finance your growth at 0% interest

## Financial Review Rhythms

**Weekly (60-90 min):**

- Cash position
- AR aging
- Pipeline movement
- Revenue/bookings

**Monthly:**

- Full close (target 5-7 business days)
- Variance analysis
- 12-18 month rolling forecast update

**Quarterly:**

- Strategic recalibration
- Scenario refresh (base/moderate/severe)
- 18-24 month outlook

| Category        | Metrics                                | Targets                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Revenue         | MRR/ARR, growth rate, NRR              | NRR >100%, growth 15-25% YoY                |
| Unit economics  | LTV:CAC, CAC payback, gross margin     | 3:1+, <12 mo, 70-80%                        |
| Cash            | Burn rate, runway, operating cash flow | Runway 24-36 months                         |
| Customer health | Churn, concentration                   | Monthly churn <2%, no customer >10% revenue |

**Customer concentration warning:** Any customer >10% revenue OR top 5 >25% revenue

## Forecasting Approach

Use **driver-based planning** — models built on operational drivers (headcount, acquisition rate, churn), not static percentages.

**MRR buildup model:**

```
Starting MRR + New Bookings + Expansion - Churn = Ending MRR
```

**13-week cash flow forecast:**

- Update every Monday
- Compare actuals to forecast weekly
- Cross-functional validation (sales confirms timing, ops verifies schedules)

**Always maintain three scenarios:**

- Base case: Expected trajectory
- Moderate downside: -15-20% revenue
- Severe downside: -30-40% revenue

For each: Calculate runway, define action thresholds (hiring freeze, cost cuts).

## Spending Benchmarks ($3-5M ARR)

- Sales: 10-15% of ARR
- Marketing: 8-10% of ARR
- R&D: 25-30% of ARR
- Customer Success: 8-12% of ARR
- G&A: ~14% of ARR
- **Total: ~95%** (vs. 107% for VC-backed)
