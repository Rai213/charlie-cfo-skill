# Charlie

A Claude Code skill for bootstrapped CFO financial management.

Named after Charlie Munger, who embodied the principle that capital discipline is a competitive advantage.

## What It Does

Charlie provides financial frameworks for bootstrapped, high-growth startups:

- **Cash management** — Runway calculations, reserve structures, burn analysis
- **Unit economics** — LTV:CAC ratios, CAC payback, gross margin targets
- **Capital allocation** — Hiring ROI, Rule of 40, investment payback periods
- **Working capital** — Cash conversion cycle, AR/AP optimization, prepay strategies
- **Forecasting** — Driver-based planning, scenario modeling, 13-week cash flow

## Installation

```bash
# Add to your Claude Code skills
cp -r . ~/.claude/skills/charlie/
```

Or add to your project's `.claude/skills/` directory.

## Usage

Once installed, Charlie activates automatically when you ask financial questions:

- "Should we make this hire?"
- "How much runway do we need?"
- "What metrics should I track?"
- "How do I forecast revenue?"
- "What's a healthy LTV:CAC ratio?"

## Philosophy

**Profit is a constraint, not a goal.** Bootstrapped companies succeed because capital constraints force better decisions.

Key principles:
- Unit economics are survival requirements, not nice-to-haves
- Revenue per employee matters more than headcount
- Runway targets: 24-36 months minimum
- Every investment needs a <12 month payback period
